It does take time to build web applications and do front end development in Python\n\n 2. Flask and Django great but both have learning curves and pros and cons\n\n 3. Use Anvil to both prototype and also production applications\n\n 4. Community already has built templates using libraries such as Plotly for data representation\n\n 5. Drag and drop to wireframe then get under the hood with the code to customise and functionalise the application\n\n 6. Free version has some good functionality but some limitations such as Python 2.\n\n 7. Well worth having this in your skill repertoire to get applications up and running quickly\n\nPhil did a demo of a classic car data project which generated discussion on the various elements throughout the demo and covered:\n\n * Beautiful soup - for web scraping.\n\n * Safari developer tools to inspect page elements and discover APIs\n\n * Interrogate API with Postman\n\n * JSON structure same as a Python dictionary therefore can index through without much additional knowledge of JSON!\n\n * Used Atom as IDE for project, developed by GitHub, now owned by Microsoft, as is VS Code.\n\n * Used Pretty JSON  (Mark recommended pprint library)\n\n * DynamoDB. No sql databases. Good to store and interrogate JSON data.\n\n * AWS Boto3 is the AWS Python SDK\n\n * Bonhams classic card auction database has 38000 records since 2003!\n\n * Data cleaning -  as data fields are used for different purposes over the years therefore inconsistent and difficult to clean.\n\n * Dataquest for learning data cleansing (thanks Dave) and regular expressions. Regex 101 to test statements (thanks again Dave!).\n\n * Build and test functions in Jupyter then lift over to .py script.\n\n * Rebuilt workflow for a AWS Lambda function to check database every day.\n\n * Converting fx rates using CSV data from US Fed using request library.\n\n * String library and punctuation module.\n\n * My SQL Workbench from Oracle to see database and build SQL queries.\n\n * Exploring data with tableau (quick demo of Tableau).\n\n * Lambda functions in Aws runs the python scripts everyday.\n\n * It is in github\n\n * How to hide credentials in code in GitHub?\n\n * Discussed use cases for data and discussed reasons why perhaps Bonhams not using their own data (data consistency, cleanliness etc)?\n\n * Discussed whether there is a common language for these kinds of get requests\n\n * Quick discussion of the re library (regex)\n\n * Quick discussion on NoSQL vs SQL database\n\n== Resources ==\n\n * [[https:\/\/anvil.works\/|Anvil]]\n * [[https:\/\/www.getpostman.com\/|Postman]]\n * [[https:\/\/www.crummy.com\/software\/BeautifulSoup\/|Beautiful Soup]]\n * [[https:\/\/www.dataquest.io\/|Data Quest]]\n * [[https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/library\/re.html|Python Regular Expressions]]\n * [[https:\/\/regex101.com\/|Regex 101]]\n","5":"= 2019-07 July Jersey Meetup =\n\n17:30 - Unit 13, Le Capelain House, Castle Quay [[https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/@49.1824762,-2.1155164,20z|Map]]\n\n4 attendees, thanks to Phil for the use of his office (despite his not even being on the island!)\n\n== Notes ==\n\n * General Intros and chat\n * Discussion of Anvil performance, tracing using timing functions and why having database queries in a loop is a bad idea\n * Discussion of SQLness vs Excelness for structuring data\n * Quick demo of Docker and Python (code in the link below)\n * Discussion of MRM originated, CIPUG project to build a CMS for use on this site and by members\n * Demo of Github config for the same\n * Closing chat re data gathering tools and the possibility of a simple, common language to describe data\n\n== Resources ==\n\n * [[https:\/\/blog.jupyter.org\/and-voil%C3%A0-f6a2c08a4a93|Voil\u00e0 - Jupyter Notebooks Dashboard]]\n * [[https:\/\/github.com\/cipug\/docker-demo|Docker demo code]]\n * [[https:\/\/github.com\/cipug\/literate-robot\/|CIPUG Blog Project]]\n","6":"= 2019-08-29 August Jersey Meetup =\n\n17:30 - Unit 13, Le Capelain House, Castle Quay [[https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/@49.1824762,-2.1155164,20z|Map]]\n\n== Notes ==\n\n5 attendees\n\nNow standard thankyous to Phil for providing space for this month's meet up.\n\n * General hellos\n * DWE Kaggle competition \n * Literate robot \n   * Anyone wants to get involved just shout (on Slack)\n   * Bit of Wagtail discussion\n\n * Mark\u2019s open data project\n   * Performance issues have been resolved \n   * CKAN \n   * Opendata.gov.je\n\n * Power consumption data sets\n   * For different industries\n   * Has Jersey got sustainable power water supply plans?\n   * Growth of electric cars?\n\n * Poetry\n * New package manager\n\n * Resources\n * Where do we find stuff?\n * Resource list on the site?\n\n * Data extraction\n   * JSON and scraping \n   * Facebook & caching\n   * The Great Hack\n\n * Miscellany\n   * Digital nomads\n   * Rhoombas that go upstairs\n   * Killer sex dolls\n   * AI in the media\n\n== Resources ==\n\n * [[https:\/\/poetry.eustace.io|Poetry Env & Package Manager]]\n * [[https:\/\/www.snowflake.com\/technology-partners\/amazon-web-services\/|Snowflake Data Warehouse Solution]]\n * [[https:\/\/Opendata.gov.je|Opendata.gov.je]]\n * [[https:\/\/ckan.org\/|CKAN]]\n","7":"= 2019-09-??
