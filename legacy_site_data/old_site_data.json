It does take time to build web applications and do front end development in Python\n\n 2. Flask and Django great but both have learning curves and pros and cons\n\n 3. Use Anvil to both prototype and also production applications\n\n 4. Community already has built templates using libraries such as Plotly for data representation\n\n 5. Drag and drop to wireframe then get under the hood with the code to customise and functionalise the application\n\n 6. Free version has some good functionality but some limitations such as Python 2.\n\n 7. Well worth having this in your skill repertoire to get applications up and running quickly\n\nPhil did a demo of a classic car data project which generated discussion on the various elements throughout the demo and covered:\n\n * Beautiful soup - for web scraping.\n\n * Safari developer tools to inspect page elements and discover APIs\n\n * Interrogate API with Postman\n\n * JSON structure same as a Python dictionary therefore can index through without much additional knowledge of JSON!\n\n * Used Atom as IDE for project, developed by GitHub, now owned by Microsoft, as is VS Code.\n\n * Used Pretty JSON  (Mark recommended pprint library)\n\n * DynamoDB. No sql databases. Good to store and interrogate JSON data.\n\n * AWS Boto3 is the AWS Python SDK\n\n * Bonhams classic card auction database has 38000 records since 2003!\n\n * Data cleaning -  as data fields are used for different purposes over the years therefore inconsistent and difficult to clean.\n\n * Dataquest for learning data cleansing (thanks Dave) and regular expressions. Regex 101 to test statements (thanks again Dave!).\n\n * Build and test functions in Jupyter then lift over to .py script.\n\n * Rebuilt workflow for a AWS Lambda function to check database every day.\n\n * Converting fx rates using CSV data from US Fed using request library.\n\n * String library and punctuation module.\n\n * My SQL Workbench from Oracle to see database and build SQL queries.\n\n * Exploring data with tableau (quick demo of Tableau).\n\n * Lambda functions in Aws runs the python scripts everyday.\n\n * It is in github\n\n * How to hide credentials in code in GitHub?\n\n * Discussed use cases for data and discussed reasons why perhaps Bonhams not using their own data (data consistency, cleanliness etc)?\n\n * Discussed whether there is a common language for these kinds of get requests\n\n * Quick discussion of the re library (regex)\n\n * Quick discussion on NoSQL vs SQL database\n\n== Resources ==\n\n * [[https://anvil.works/|Anvil]]\n * [[https://www.getpostman.com/|Postman]]\n * [[https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/|Beautiful Soup]]\n * [[https://www.dataquest.io/|Data Quest]]\n * [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html|Python Regular Expressions]]\n * [[https://regex101.com/|Regex 101]]\n",

        "12": "= Channel Islands Python User Group Code of Conduct =\n\nThe Channel Islands Python User Group (CIPUG) community is made up of members from a range of different backgrounds with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences great successes and continued growth. When you're working with members of the community, we encourage you to follow these guidelines which help steer our interactions and strive to keep ours a positive, successful, and growing community.\n\nA member of the CIPUG community is:\n\n'''Open'''\n\nMembers of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on projects, demos, problems, or otherwise. We're receptive to constructive comment and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts. We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.\n\n'''Considerate'''\n\nMembers of the community are considerate of their peers -- other Python users. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the community. We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.\n\n'''Respectful'''\n\nMembers of the community are respectful. We are respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We are respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate user group and the wider Python community. We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.\n\nOverall, we're good to each other. We contribute to this community not because we have to, but because we want to. If we remember that, these guidelines will come naturally.\n\nExamples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:\n\n * Being kind to others\n * Behaving professionally\n * Using welcoming and inclusive language\n * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\n * Gracefully accepting constructive criticism\n * Focusing on what is best for the community\n * Showing empathy towards other community members\n\nExamples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:\n\n * Harassment of conference participants in any form\n * Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following\n * Violent threats or language directed against another person\n * Sexual language and imagery in any conference venue, including talks\n * Insults or put downs\n * Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes\n * Unwelcome sexual attention or advances\n * Unwelcome physical contact\n * Sustained disruption of events\n * Other conduct that is inappropriate for a professional group including people of many different backgrounds\n\nMembers asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately.\n\nIf a member engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the CIPUG organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or temporary or permanent expulsion from the group.\n\n== Scope ==\n\nAll CIPUG Members are subject to the Code of Conduct when engaged in any CIPUG related activity. This includes meet-ups, hackathons, online chat whether private or public, email exchanges and face to face interaction. The Code of Conduct applies equally to all members regardless of duration of membership or other professional or personal affiliation.\n\n== Contact Details ==\n\nThank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.\n\nQuestions/comments/reports? Please write to coc@cipug.org. \n\n== Version History ==\n\n * 2019-07-01 - v1.0.0 - initial version\n\nNote: this document is based on a combination of the [[https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/|Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct]] and the [[https://us.pycon.org/2019/about/code-of-conduct/|PyCon US Code of Conduct]].\n"
